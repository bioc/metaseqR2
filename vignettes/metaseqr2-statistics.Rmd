RNA-Seq data analysis using mulitple statistical algorithms with metaseqR2
================================================================================

During the past years, a lot of packages have been developed for the analysis of 
RNA-Seq data, introducing several approaches. Many of them live in Bioconductor. 
Furthermore, different statistical approaches and heuristics are used in a
continuous effort to improve overall accuracy. Such approaches include packages
using the negative binomial distribution to model the null hypotheses (*DESeq*, 
*DESeq2*, *edgeR*, *NBPSeq*, "ABSSeq"), packages using Bayesian statistics 
(*baySeq*, *EBSeq*) or more hybrid solutions (*NOISeq*, *voom*). In addition, 
packages specialized to RNA-Seq data normalization have also been developed 
(*EDASeq*, *RUVSeq*). The first version of the *metaseqR* package (pronounced 
meta-seek-er) provided an interface to several algorithms for normalization and 
statistical analysis and at the same time provided PANDORA, a novel p-value 
combination method. PANDORA
metaseqR2, is the continuation of metaseqR is much simpler to use than
\emph{TCC}, incoporates more algorithms for normalization and statistical analysis
and builds a full report with several interactive and non-interactive diagnostic
plots so that the users can easily explore the results and have whatever they need
for this part of their research in one place. The metaseqR report is one of its
most strong points as it provides an automatically generated summary, based on the
pipeline inputs and the results, which can be used directly as a draft in methods
paragraph in scientific publications. It also provides a lot of diagnostic figures
and each figure is accompanied by a small explanatory text, and a list of
references accroding to the algorithms used in the pipeline, which can also be
used in a scientific article. All the report components are grouped in a
comprehensive way, with a table of contents. Most importantly, metaseqR provides
an interface for RNA-Seq data meta-analysis by providing the ability to use
different algorithms for the statistical testing part and combining the p-values
using popular published methods (e.g. Fisher's method, Whitlock's method) and two
package-specific methods (intersection, union of statistically significant results).
In the future, more algorithms will be incorporated in the package, with more
diagnostic plots and more examples. This initial vignette contains just this
introductory text and reference to some examples in the package documentation,
which we believe that at this point contains sufficient explanation to run the
metaseqr pipeline. Throughout the rest of this document, \emph{metaseqr} refers
to the name of the analysis pipeline while \emph{metaseqR} refers to the name of
the package.


## Getting started

```{r load-library echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(metaseqR2)
```

Detailed instructions on how to run the metaseqr pipeline can be found under the
main documentation of the metaseqR2 package:

```{r init-metaseqr, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
help(metaseqr2)
```

Briefly, to run metaseqr2 you need:
